* Open your browser to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and click the 'seed' button to begin.

  * You will notice rather quickly that there are only dots, and not numbers. Unfortunately, I was unable to complete the assignment with the given ruleset.
  
  * Instead of submitting faulty code, I built a version of Conway's Game of Life.
