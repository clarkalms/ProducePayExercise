# REVISIONS

## Given more time I would have:

  * Completed the project according to the given ruleset.
  * Separated the main functions into their own components to make a cleaner layout.
  * Added more CSS for a better user experience (e.g. use emojis instead of numbers for baby, adult, senior).
